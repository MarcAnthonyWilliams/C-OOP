CS2124: Object-Oriented Programming in C++ - NYU
This repository serves as a collection of my homework and lab assignments from NYU's CS2124: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. The projects contained here demonstrate my understanding and application of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to showcase my personal progress and mastery of OOP concepts through practical assignments and projects. The code reflects my learning journey and adherence to clean coding practices, as well as the use of C++ features like classes, data hiding, and delegation.
